IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PDF SETS

LHAPDF no longer bundles PDF set data in the package tarball.
The sets are instead all stored online at
  http://lhapdfsets.web.cern.ch/lhapdfsets/current/
and you should install those that you wish to use into
  /home/username/LHAPDF/LHAPDF_install/share/LHAPDF
  
 ************ (in the terminal do: $  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/username/LHAPDF/LHAPDF_install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH).**************
 
 ******compile: $g++ -O3 -I/home/username/LHAPDF/LHAPDF_install/include -L/home/username/LHAPDF/LHAPDF_install/lib epps21_pdf.cc -o epps21_pdf -lLHAPDF)********

 ****execute: $./output***********88

The downloadable PDF sets are packaged as tarballs, which
must be expanded to be used. The simplest way to do this is with
the 'lhapdf' script, e.g. to install the CT10nlo PDF set:
  lhapdf install CT10nlo
  
The same effect can be achieved manually with, e.g.:
  wget http://lhapdfsets.web.cern.ch/lhapdfsets/current/CT10nlo.tar.gz -O- | tar xz -C /home/username/LHAPDF/LHAPDF_install/share/LHAPDF
  
  
 Also, to download EPPS21:
wget http://lhapdfsets.web.cern.ch/lhapdfsets/current/EPPS21nlo_CT18Anlo_Pb208.tar.gz -O- | tar xz -C /home/username/LHAPDF/LHAPDF_install/share/LHAPDF

   4. Using LHAPDF

All input and outputs are defined in DOUBLE PRECISION

There are three options to make a single PDF dataset:

PDF * lhapdf.mkPDF(int lhaid)

Below is an example:

“variable name” = lhapdf.mkPDF(“filename”)

            Returns PDFs as vector<PDF*>

PDF * lhapdf.mkPDF(const std.string &setname, int member)

Ex: “variable name” = lhapdf.mkPDF(setname,imem)

 

PDF * lhapdf.mkPDF(const str.string &setname_nmen)

Where “variable name” is whatever name you want to give to the assigned variable.

For making whole PDF sets:

“variable name” = lhapdf.getPDFSet(‘filename’)

            lhapdf.getPDFSet() will allow you to use the raw data from a dataset.

                        à “Info” is a class of function. In this case, Info() is a default constructor.
